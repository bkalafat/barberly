# ✅ Database Configuration Complete!

Your Supabase database configuration has been set up securely. Here's what was created:

## Files Created/Updated:

### 1. Environment Configuration

- ✅ `backend/.env` - Contains your Supabase credentials (NOT committed to git)
- ✅ `backend/.env.example` - Template for other developers
- ✅ `backend/DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Complete setup documentation

### 2. Scripts

- ✅ `backend/migrate.ps1` - PowerShell script to run migrations with environment variables
- ✅ `backend/setup-github-secret.ps1` - Helper script to set GitHub secrets

### 3. GitHub Actions

- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/backend.yml` to use Supabase in CI
- ✅ Added EF migrations step to workflow

## Next Steps:

### 1. Test Local Migrations (Required)

Run this in PowerShell from the repo root:

```powershell
cd backend
.\migrate.ps1 -UseSupabase
```

### 2. Set GitHub Secret (Required for CI)

Choose one option:

**Option A: Automatic (if you have GitHub CLI)**

```powershell
cd backend
.\setup-github-secret.ps1 -SetSecret
```

**Option B: Manual**

1. Go to: https://github.com/bkalafat/barberly/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `SUPABASE_CONNECTION`
4. Value: `Host=aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com;Port=6543;Database=postgres;Username=postgres.cpibdbtyvpyduuyispxj;Password=!vxT8ap5Pxj._Kz;SSL Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true`

### 3. Test CI (After setting secret)

Push a commit to trigger GitHub Actions and verify the workflow uses Supabase successfully.

## Security Notes:

- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- ✅ `appsettings.json` cleaned of sensitive data
- ✅ GitHub secret will be encrypted and only accessible to workflows
- ⚠️ Consider rotating the password periodically in Supabase dashboard

## Troubleshooting:

- If migrations fail: Check the connection string and Supabase project status
- If CI fails: Verify the GitHub secret was set correctly
- For local dev: You can still use the existing local PostgreSQL by running `.\migrate.ps1` without `-UseSupabase`
